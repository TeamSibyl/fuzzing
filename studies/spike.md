## SPIKE: C based fuzzer creation kit

SPIKE is the grandfather of all fuzzers, and it ther first major effort to abstract fuzzers into a framework.  
It functions as a fuzzer creation kit, providing an API that allows a user to create their own fuzzers for network based protocols using the C programming language.
Unfortunately, SPIKE has terible documentation and support, and today has fallen mostly into obscurity.
